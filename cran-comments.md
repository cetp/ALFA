## Notes for Windows 
This package fails the tests on win-builder (devel and release). ALFA requires that Python â‰¥ 3.5 be installed, and a set of python packages be installed. That does not appear to be the case on the win-builder server. Our tests on our windows machines show that it can be built, installed, and functions as expected once Python and the required packages are installed.
